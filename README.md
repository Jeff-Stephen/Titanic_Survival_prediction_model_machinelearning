# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning model built using logistic regression to predict the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors.

## Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we aim to predict whether a passenger survived or not using logistic regression. The dataset includes various features such as passenger class, age, gender, and more, which we use to train our model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition. It contains information on Titanic passengers and their survival status.

- `train.csv`: Training dataset used to build the model.
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jeff-Stephen/titanic-survival-prediction.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in the project directory.
3. Open the `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

We assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the model's performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Results

Our model achieved an accuracy of around 75% on the test dataset. Further details and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
